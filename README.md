# Japanese-Learner
In the study of a language, it is important to remember characters and pronunciations in order to read, write, and speak properly. I had the problem of memorizing characters when I first learnt Japanese. Hiragana and Katakana are two forms for one character and they have the same pronunciation, which is Romaji. Therefore, I designed this program of Japanese character pronunciation quiz, which contains 3 modes: hiragana, katakana, or mixed. Once the user put in their username and select the mode, the program will start to test the user by providing 50 questions and let them select the correct romaji (pronunciation) out of 4 choices for the hiragana or katakana depend on modes the user choose. After the test, the user will receive a training log result in an txt file that recorded their performance for them to see which character can they improve in.
